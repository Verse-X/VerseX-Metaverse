# Introduction:
VerseX is a collaborative group of like-minded individuals dedicated to developing innovative solutions for the metaverse. Through our platform, users are able to interact with the real world through augmented reality, virtual reality and blockchain technology. The VerseX Shopping Mall Complex will allow users to create their own virtual shops that will provide real-life items to other players within the metaverse by replicating real-life behaviors and shipping processes. Our project operates as a decentralized autonomous organization with its payment systems to be integrated onto the XRPL. Play-to-Earn will be incorporated into the game, where players can log in and earn directly to their crypto wallets by completing challenges.

# Why the XRPL?
Our company intends to leverage the capabilities of the XRP Ledgers, which are carbon-neutral, open-source public blockchains with incomparable speed, cost efficiencies, and scalability. When ODL corridors are added to the XRPL Ecosystem, it will affect everyone involved with the XRP network and ecosystem. In addition, we would like to raise awareness to a broader audience as to what the blockchain technology is capable of achieving, in particular the XRPL. In addition to ensuring that Ripple and XRP receive the recognition they deserve, we are committed to sharing the spotlight with this revolutionary technology.
